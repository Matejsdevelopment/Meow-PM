The Meow PM is a package manager for arch based linux distros.
Meow only hosts an API, not all the files.The API gives to the client the git link of the app, a version and a creator, not the file itself.Meow then installs 
the package and builds it.
You can also choose to install packages from the AUR,Flathub(flatpak) and pacman.

Disclaimer!
The Meow API is not hosted yet,which means that you can't use Meow normally.
I will likely develop Meow further , allow accounts,host the API...
To update Meow you need to install the desired version on github, uninstall Meow and finally build it again.

The Meow API is not open source.Maybe it will be in the future.
Some functions are absolutely useless, but maybe will be used in the future too.
